# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principle Compliance

- **Marketing Automation Service**: Feature MUST maintain marketing automation capabilities and campaign management tools
- **API Key Authentication**: All new endpoints MUST require API key authentication if they expose sensitive functionality
- **Content Generation Reliability**: Any content generation features MUST maintain service reliability and health checks
- **Comprehensive Logging & Analytics**: All new operations MUST include structured logging with marketing context and analytics
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Input validation and error handling MUST be implemented for all new endpoints
- **Marketing Tool Organization**: Every new marketing tool MUST have its own dedicated folder with tests and documentation

### Security Requirements

- CORS, rate limiting, and security headers MUST be considered for new endpoints
- Environment variable management MUST be used for any new configuration
- API key handling MUST follow established patterns

### Development Workflow

- Code MUST follow linting and formatting standards
- Tests MUST be written for critical new functionality
- Health check endpoints MUST be updated if new services are added
- API documentation MUST be updated for any new endpoints

### API Testing & Validation

- **Central Postman Collection**: All new API endpoints MUST be added to the central Postman collection with comprehensive test cases
- **Automated Testing**: New endpoints MUST have corresponding Postman test cases covering success/failure scenarios, authentication, and validation
- **Environment Testing**: Test cases MUST be configured to run against multiple environments (dev/staging/production)
- **Deployment Validation**: Postman collection MUST be integrated into CI/CD pipeline for deployment validation

### Swagger Documentation Standards

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All new API endpoints MUST have extensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with quality examples
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Documentation MUST cover all error scenarios including validation, authentication, rate limiting, and service errors
- **Code Synchronization**: Documentation MUST be automatically generated from code annotations and kept synchronized
- **Example Quality**: Every endpoint MUST have realistic example requests and responses demonstrating proper usage patterns

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
