# Tasks: Marlin Marketing Agent Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-this-should-operate/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize TypeScript project with Express.js dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] T004 [P] Setup Jest testing framework with TypeScript support

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Setup OpenAI API configuration in src/config/openai.ts
- [x] T006 [P] Implement API key authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts
- [x] T007 [P] Setup Express.js routing and middleware structure in src/index.ts
- [x] T008 Create base error handling middleware in src/middleware/errorHandler.ts
- [x] T009 [P] Setup structured logging middleware in src/middleware/logger.ts
- [x] T010 [P] Configure rate limiting middleware in src/middleware/rateLimit.ts
- [x] T011 Setup environment configuration management
- [x] T012 Configure security middleware (helmet, cors) in src/config/server.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Hello World API Endpoint (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Build a GET endpoint at `/hello` that returns AI-generated welcome messages with current time and day information

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a GET request to `/hello` and verifying that it returns a JSON response with a message containing current time and day information generated by an AI model

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Contract test for /hello endpoint in tests/hello.test.ts
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Integration test for AI service interaction in tests/hello.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Create HelloResponse interface in src/models/HelloResponse.ts
- [x] T016 [P] [US1] Create AIModelConfig interface in src/models/AIModelConfig.ts
- [x] T017 [US1] Implement LLM service in src/services/llmService.ts (depends on T015, T016)
- [x] T018 [US1] Implement /hello endpoint in src/routes/hello.ts
- [x] T019 [US1] Add validation and error handling for AI service failures
- [x] T020 [US1] Add structured logging for AI interactions and marketing analytics
- [x] T021 [US1] Create hello endpoint folder structure with tests and documentation per constitution
- [ ] T022 [P] [US1] Add /hello endpoint to central Postman collection with comprehensive test cases
- [ ] T023 [P] [US1] Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for /hello endpoint with examples and error scenarios

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Server Health and Monitoring (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide a `/health` endpoint for monitoring server status and AI service availability

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a GET request to `/health` and verifying standard health check response format

### Tests for User Story 2

- [x] T024 [P] [US2] Contract test for /health endpoint in tests/health.test.ts
- [x] T025 [P] [US2] Integration test for health monitoring in tests/health.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T026 [P] [US2] Create HealthResponse interface in src/models/HealthResponse.ts
- [x] T027 [US2] Implement health check service in src/services/healthService.ts
- [x] T028 [US2] Implement /health endpoint in src/routes/health.ts
- [x] T029 [US2] Integrate AI service status monitoring with User Story 1 components
- [x] T030 [US2] Create health endpoint folder structure with tests and documentation per constitution
- [ ] T031 [P] [US2] Add /health endpoint to central Postman collection with comprehensive test cases
- [ ] T032 [P] [US2] Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for /health endpoint with examples and error scenarios

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2)
- **Constitution Compliance (Phase 5)**: Can start after User Stories are complete
  - Basic agent architecture can be designed in parallel with implementation
  - Postman collection and Swagger docs can be created in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all previous phases being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add Constitution Compliance (Phase 5) ‚Üí Basic agent architecture
5. Add Polish (Phase 6) ‚Üí Final cleanup and validation
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
