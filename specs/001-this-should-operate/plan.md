# Implementation Plan: Marlin Marketing Agent Server

**Branch**: `001-this-should-operate` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-this-should-operate/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Build a Marlin Marketing Agent server with a `/hello` endpoint that returns AI-generated welcome messages including current time and day information. The server must follow the welcome-agent baseline pattern with TypeScript/Express.js, OpenAI integration, comprehensive security middleware, and proper health monitoring. Technical approach uses existing codebase structure with AI service integration for marketing automation capabilities.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/Node.js 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, OpenAI API, helmet, cors, express-rate-limit  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless API server)  
**Testing**: Jest with supertest for API testing  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Heroku deployment)  
**Project Type**: single (API server)  
**Performance Goals**: 95% of requests within 5 seconds, health endpoint <100ms  
**Constraints**: <5 second response time for /hello endpoint, graceful AI model failure handling  
**Scale/Scope**: Marketing automation service with AI-powered content generation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principle Compliance

- **Basic Agent Functionality**: ✅ Feature maintains basic agent capabilities through AI-powered content generation
- **API Key Authentication**: ✅ /hello endpoint will use API key authentication for security
- **Content Generation Reliability**: ✅ AI model integration with fallback mechanisms and health checks
- **Comprehensive Logging & Analytics**: ✅ Structured logging for all agent operations and AI interactions
- **Error Handling & Validation**: ✅ Input validation and standardized error responses for all endpoints
- **Agent Tool Organization**: ✅ /hello endpoint follows established patterns with dedicated testing

### Security Requirements

- ✅ CORS, rate limiting, and security headers implemented via helmet, cors, express-rate-limit
- ✅ Environment variable management for OpenAI API configuration
- ✅ API key handling follows established patterns with X-API-Key header support

### Development Workflow

- ✅ Code follows TypeScript linting and formatting standards
- ✅ Jest tests written for /hello and /health endpoints
- ✅ Health check endpoint updated to include AI service status
- ✅ API documentation updated with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications

### API Testing & Validation

- ✅ **Central Postman Collection**: Complete Postman collection created from scratch with comprehensive test cases for all endpoints
- ✅ **Automated Testing**: Postman test cases cover success/failure scenarios, authentication, rate limiting, and AI model validation
- ✅ **Environment Testing**: Test cases configured for dev/staging/production environments with environment variables
- ✅ **Deployment Validation**: Postman collection integrated into CI/CD pipeline with automated test result reporting

### Swagger Documentation Standards

- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification with detailed endpoint descriptions and examples
- ✅ **Error Scenario Coverage**: Documentation covers all error scenarios including validation, authentication, rate limiting, and service failures
- ✅ **Code Synchronization**: Documentation automatically generated from code annotations and kept synchronized
- ✅ **Example Quality**: Realistic example requests and responses with error handling guidance and remediation steps
- ✅ **Agent Functionality**: Documentation includes basic agent service architecture and API specifications

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
