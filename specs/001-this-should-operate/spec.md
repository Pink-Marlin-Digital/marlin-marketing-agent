# Feature Specification: Marlin Marketing Agent Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-should-operate`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This should operate like our other baseline Agent servers. You can use the welcome-agent as a basis for the server set up. Build the first api route in this server called hello world. This should be a GET route at /hello and return a { message: "<some agent response>" } where it promts a model to respond with a welcome message with the time and day."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Hello World API Endpoint (Priority: P1)

A developer or system integrator needs to verify that the Marlin Marketing Agent server is operational and can generate AI-powered responses through a simple hello world endpoint.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational endpoint that establishes the server's basic functionality and AI integration capability. It serves as a health check and proof-of-concept for the AI model integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a GET request to `/hello` and verifying that it returns a JSON response with a message containing current time and day information generated by an AI model.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/hello`, **Then** the response should be a JSON object with a `message` field containing an AI-generated welcome message that includes the current time and day
2. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/hello`, **Then** the response should return HTTP status 200
3. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/hello`, **Then** the response should complete within 5 seconds

### User Story 2 - Server Health and Monitoring (Priority: P2)

A system administrator needs to monitor the server's health and operational status to ensure it's running properly.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production deployment and monitoring, but secondary to the core AI functionality demonstration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a GET request to `/health` and verifying standard health check response format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/health`, **Then** the response should include status, timestamp, version, and uptime information
2. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/health`, **Then** the response should return HTTP status 200

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI model service is unavailable or times out?
- How does the system handle malformed requests to the `/hello` endpoint?
- What occurs when the server is under high load or rate limiting is triggered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a GET endpoint at `/hello` that returns a JSON response with a `message` field
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with an AI model to generate welcome messages that include current time and day information
- **FR-003**: System MUST return responses within 5 seconds for the `/hello` endpoint
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a `/health` endpoint for monitoring server status
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle AI model failures gracefully with appropriate error responses
- **FR-006**: System MUST follow the same architectural patterns as the welcome-agent server
- **FR-007**: System MUST use TypeScript and Express.js framework
- **FR-008**: System MUST include proper error handling and logging middleware
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support environment-based configuration for AI model settings

### Key Entities

- **HelloResponse**: JSON response object containing the AI-generated message with time and day information
- **HealthResponse**: JSON response object containing server status, timestamp, version, and uptime information
- **AIModelConfig**: Configuration object for AI model settings including model type, temperature, and timeout values

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The `/hello` endpoint responds successfully (HTTP 200) in 95% of requests within 5 seconds
- **SC-002**: The AI-generated message includes current time and day information in 100% of successful responses
- **SC-003**: The server maintains 99% uptime during normal operation periods
- **SC-004**: The `/health` endpoint responds within 100ms for 99% of requests
- **SC-005**: The server handles AI model failures gracefully, returning appropriate error responses without crashing

## Assumptions

- The server will use OpenAI's GPT models for AI message generation (following welcome-agent pattern)
- Environment variables will be used for AI model configuration (API key, model type, temperature)
- The server will run on Node.js with TypeScript compilation
- Standard Express.js middleware stack will be implemented for security and logging
- The AI model will be prompted to include current date/time information in its response
- Development and production environments will have different AI model configurations
- The server will follow the same project structure and patterns as the welcome-agent

## Dependencies

- OpenAI API access and valid API key
- Node.js runtime environment (version 20 or higher)
- TypeScript compilation environment
- Express.js framework and related middleware packages
- Environment configuration for AI model settings

## Out of Scope

- Complex AI prompt engineering beyond basic time/day inclusion
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- User authentication or authorization
- Database persistence for request logs
- Advanced monitoring and metrics collection
- Multiple AI model providers or fallback mechanisms
